Here is the first and hopefully final and comprehensive 

ways to use git;
    command line
    code editors and ide's
    =source control panel in vscode
        gitlens extension
    gui clients for using git, (gitgui) (git kraken and sourcetree)
    integrates with other git krake tools (annual fee ew)
    source tree (free but windows or mac)

using CLI in this first tutorial WOOO
-gui tools have limitations
-gui tools aren't always available
-use the right tool for the job
